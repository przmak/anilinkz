AD Blocker for Goolge Chrome for a website with anime 

You need to add this extension manually in chrome://extensions
You need to be in developer mode.

Does not work yet for all v-streams and doesn't block all crap yet.

You need to click link "Watch Episode" button, and the video will open in new window without adds (will try to work on it to move it to the same page, someday)

Version 0.0.2
